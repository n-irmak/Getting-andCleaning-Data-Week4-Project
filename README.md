#Peer-graded Assignment: Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project

This repository belonging to **NESRIN IRMAK KOKER** contains this `README.md` file, a R file named `run_analysis.R`, a codebook file called `CODEBOOK.md` explaining the code of said R file and a txt file named `TidyData.txt` that is the result of said R file. 

`run_analysis.R` modifies and cleans an already tidy dataset by selecting and extracting certain types of data, labeling it appropriately and forms a final data set and writes it into the `TidyData.txt` file that is in this repository as mentioned.
